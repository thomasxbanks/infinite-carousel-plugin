# Infinite Carousel

A jQuery carousel plugin. Another one. This is super simple and does but one job!

## Usage

1. Put `infinite-carousel.js` somewhere in your project and point to it. (`index.html` has an example if you're stuck!)
1. Stick some repeatable list type markup in your html
1. Define your (optional) options
1. Init the plugin
1. Watch in wonder as it just works! :p

## Options and defaults
- `slide`: `li` (default). Alternatively, if you're not using lists, name the child element (or .class or data-attr)
- `speed`: Usual jQuery speeds: `fast`, `slow`, int in ms (_eg_ 500 (default))
- `delay`: Usual jQuery speeds: `fast`, `slow`, int in ms (_eg_ 3000 (default))
